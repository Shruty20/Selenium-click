# Selenium-click
This Python script utilizes the Selenium WebDriver to automate the submission of a form on a web page. It interacts with a sample website ("http://secure-retreat-92358.herokuapp.com/") and fills out the form with predefined data.


# Prerequisites:

# The script performs the following actions:
It opens the Chrome browser using the ChromeDriver.
It navigates to the specified web page.
It locates the input fields for first name, last name, and email on the form.
It enters the values "Shruty" for the first name, "Aggarwal" for the last name, and "shrutyaggarwal2002@gmail.com" for the email.
It locates the submit button and clicks on it.
The script essentially fills out a form on the web page and submits it.
